									<h2>Slime Climb</h2>
									<p>Climb to freedom as Hopper the happy slime by using his stretchy arms to grapple to walls! I worked with a team of other aspiring game developers to produce this game in the first week of starting
									 university, for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gt-jam/entries">Staffordshire University GT Jam</a>! We called ourselves MicroPixel Studios. After all our hard work, we won the jam so be sure to check out our game below!

									<h2>Blaze</h2>
									<p>The spaceship shoot-em-up where you charge into your enemies head-first to smash them into oblivion! With Blaze, I wanted to flip the idea of a first person shooter on its head. Rather than avoiding enemies, the only
									 way to destroy them is to fly straight into them! You still have tail missiles to protect yourself from enemy projectiles, so theres a great back and forth feel to the gameplay.</p>

									<h3>Game Development</h3>
									<p>Primarily, I have used <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> to develop games for just over 3 years.

										<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine 4</a>, <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker Studio 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mv">RPG Maker MV</a>.</p>

											I have played Guitar for over 7 years and own both a Mexican Fender Stratocaster Deluxe and a Gibson Les Paul Special - a small collection I am very proud of!
											 Some of my favourite artists are The Weeknd, Keane, Two Door Cinema Club and Blossoms.
										</li>
										<li>
											I regularly go to the gym to workout and stay healthy. To me, this is especially important to break down the long hours of being sat at the computer!
										</li>
										<li>
											One of my favourite things to do with friends is play board and card games! Whether we're playing Poker, Chess, Risk or DND, its always a good time.
